## About

Mozilla Firefox is a free and open-source web browser developed by Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, Mozilla Corporation.

This add-on is based on the [docker image](https://github.com/jlesage/docker-firefox) from [Jocelyn Le Sage](https://github.com/jlesage) and the [homeassistant firefox addon](https://github.com/Mincka/ha-addons).

A huge thank to them for the great containers created and maintained.
